# SE-Assignment-2

Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

It is an approach to software development that applies the engeneering design process to develop software, that involves definition, implementation, testing, management and maintenance of software systems and with development of the software development process itself.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Sofware engeneering is using computer science, math and important engineering principles to appropriately structure software programs. It differs from programming because software engineers evaluate real life issues and try to solve them by implementing systems(that include planning, designing, building, testing and deployment and maintenance of softwares) to solve these problems. Whereas traditional programming has limited focus on writing code to instruct software programs on how and when to execute functions to deliver predetermined outcomes.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Planning- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- Analyzing requirements and identifying the best solutions to create the software.
Building- The development of the code for the software product according to design specs.
Testing- A combination of automation and manual testing to check the software for bugs.
Deployment- This is when the software that has been built is introduced to the public(users).
Maintenance- Resolving and issues from users, fixing bugs and managing or improving the software.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile method: A flexible process that encourages customer collaboraation and adaptability. It provides a working software in short regulated cycles, dividing the project into small steps. This method would go well with projects where it's necessary to make adjustments due to changing requirements. Allows flexibility which will improve teamwork and produce good quality software.

Waterfall method: Linear implementation with specific phases where they need to be completed before moving on. This method fits well with straightforward and small-scale projects with a clear understanding of the end goal due to it's strict and predictable characteristics.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

It is the area of systems engineering that deals with the process of developing and verifying the system requirements.
The process entails tasks that help in understanding, recording, and managing the demands of stakeholders. By following good practices, it helps achieve the solution, making sure that the delivered system/software meets the user's needs.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity refers to a logical seperation of the software design that allows complex software to be manageble for the purpose of implementation and maintenance. It will make code more organized, reuseable and maintainable and also improve collaboration among team members.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit test= testing done at code level, where components are tested individualy to analyze their functionality.
Intergration test= it helps identify any bugs or issues arising from coding errors or intergrations between modules.
System test= performed on an intergrated environment, where all components are assessed against specific business requirements.
Acceptance test= involes testing the system's functional and non-functional aspects.

Software testing is vital because it increases user satisfaction by making sure the software products meets the specific requirements, improves security, enhancing the development process as well as check the software adaptability and it's compatability with other platforms in order to offer a smooth user experience.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

These are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. Version control encourages a culture of continuous peer review and collaboration, leading to a significant improvements in code quality.

GitHub- allows developers to store and manage their code.
Azure DevOps- end-to-end software development platform offering various capabilities intended to organize and accelerate development efforts across the whole application lifecycle.
Apache Subversion- it can track modifications, manage workflow, user access limits and cheap local branching.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

A software project manager liasons between the development team annd the stkeholders in a software project. Theyare responsible for communicating project status managing changes and requesting additionalt resources to help complete the project. They are rseponsible for the team management, resource allocation, risk management
and continuous improvement.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

This is the process of modifying, changing and updating a software system or module to resolve errors, improve performance or adapt to a changing environment. It includes fixing bugs, monitoring how the software is being used, enhancing the software it's necessary as well as support.
Software maintenance is important because it provides maintained software functionality, makes upgrades to the code and ensures any repairs needed of the software are completed.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Engineers can face a myraid of issues that include unethical data collection, negative societal impact, accessibilty not being provide to those who need it most and privacy of users.
They can adhere to ethical standards by being honest and offering full transparency regarding advertising the product(software) and informing users of changes that were made, holding themselves and those around them accountable for choices being made, and also by being proactive like addressing potential abuse or other issues.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
